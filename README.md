# Wasted Class Time App

This is an app to calculate the percentage of a class period that is wasted by any sort of negative behaviors of students. 

I hope this app can become something useful for teachers. On a few occasions when I was still a teacher, I actually used it with my students to show them what percentage of our classes they wasted by not listening. This idea was created during the 2019-2020 school year, when I was "in the thick of it" with my classes, before the outbreak of COVID-19.

## Ideas
- It might be a good addition to have a button saying "How to use this tool" or something, that when clicked brings up a modal explaining how it works in case it's not obvious to someone.
- Long-term goal: add ability for user to add and customize classes and track the stats for each specific class, filterable by date and so on. Being able to see trends over time, including graphs, could be a useful addition.
- Preserve the user's selection for class time so they don't have to re-select their class's length every time.
- Give user option to also show the percentage calculation in real time.
