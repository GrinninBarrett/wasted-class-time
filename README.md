## Wasted Class Time App'

This file will be used to log any new goals or ideas, problems encountered, and things learned along the way. 

I hope this app can become something useful for teachers. I would personally love to use it with my students to show them what percentage of our classes they waste by being disrespectful. This idea was created last school year, when I was "in the thick of it". With COVID-19, things are obviously different now. We finished the last school year remotely, and are now preparing for our return to school under very different circumstances. I imagine because of smaller class sizes, behavior will be much less of a problem, but I would like to complete this app anyway. If things ever get back to normal, it will be nice to have this to log recurring behavior issues.
